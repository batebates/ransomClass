** Your files have been locked and encrypted with a unique RSA-2048 key. **
To unlock your files/data:
1. Download and install Multibit from http://multibit.org
This will give you your own Bitcoin-wallet address, you can find it under the Request tab. It starts with a 1.
2. Buy 0.4 BTC (Bitcoin) and send it to your OWN Bitcoin-wallet address (see step 1).
[ Find out where to buy Bitcoins at http://howtobuybitcoins.info ]
3. The Bitcoins will show up Multibit. From there, hit the Send tab.
Send the remaining Bitcoins to our Bitcoin-wallet address:
1Dga6EUkmMq7Xazxz125c9FiDTaL36wpgM
Now press OK below and enter YOUR Bitcoin-wallet address.
Press OK again and the transaction details will be sent to our server.
Once it has been manually verified, the decryption process will start.
BEWARE - this is NOT a virus.
IF your antivirus deletes it there is NO way to recover your files. 
It WILL leave your files encrypted with no way to resolve it.. you have been warned.
